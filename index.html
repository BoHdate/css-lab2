                Eric Whitney (born April 15, 1991),[7] professionally known as Ghostemane or alternatively as Baader-Meinhof, GASM,[6][8] and formerly as Ill Biz,[9] is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Originally growing up in Florida, Ghostemane started out playing in local hardcore punk and doom metal bands.[10][11] 
                He moved to Los Angeles, California after starting his career as a rapper.
                Ghostemane's merging of rap and metal gained him popularity on SoundCloud, amongst other underground artists such as Scarlxrd, Bones and Suicideboys. In 2018 Ghostemane released his seventh studio album, N/O/I/S/E, which was highly anticipated in the underground SoundCloud trap metal and emo rap scene[12] due to 
                its heavy influence from industrial and nu metal groups.
